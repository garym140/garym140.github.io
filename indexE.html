							<p>This past semester I took a class called 'Dark Data'. This class opened my eyes to the lack of privacy that exists in the world around us.</p>
							<p>We studied major nations (US , UK , India , and China) in an attempt to understand the major difference in data privacy protection laws and the lack there of within each nation.</p>

								<p> Creating this digital story took various prototypes.
									<br><br> I researched the best way to display this digital story. So I thought of showing the correspondence between 2 friends through direct messaging on FB, Instagram, or Snapchat. But then I realised that there something charming about the
									old fashion email correspondence between friends. So I went down the email route and studied the various qualities of gmail and recreated these emails.
									<br><br> The 'More Info' button wasn't implemented until later on in the process when feedback from both my classmates and professors were all questioning how this story is helping to inform those reading it of the current privacy issues we face
									in the digital space.
									<br><br> The very last 'creepy' touch in all of this are the live camera feeds that in Vietnam that I was able to hack and run 24/7 within this digital story... WILD. </p>
