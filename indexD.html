								<p> We wanted to create a game that makes people dwell on the how far they will go to win a game. By giving them an identity within the game we wanted to see how far they would go despite their disagreement with the identity given to them. We wanted them to end up questioning their morals amidst their desire to win.</p>

								<p> This game should be played with a group of people. The group size should contain more than 5 people. The more the merrier because mutiple identities would be administered.</p>

							<div class="Epara">
								<p> Creating this game took various prototypes.
								<br><br>
								With our first ideation we were trying to think of ways to mix spatial rules with a traditional game. Our first thought was to work within the kinetic space, making the users move around and be active.

							<h1 class="ProjC">Prototype 1</h1>
								<div class="Epara">
									<p>After pitching our ideation ideas we were told to simplify the gameplay. We were getting to complicated with the rules of engagement. So we simplified the game to a card game.Players were assigned an honest or lying identity, and asked to respond accordingly to pre-written questions. If a player’s identity was guessed, they were out. </p>

								<div class="Epara">
									<p>With this prototype We asked users to write down their own questions, according to how well they knew the people in the group. We also tested using tokens:Rather than winning based upon elimination, we set a goal of accumulating the most tokens.</p>

							<h1 class="ProjC">Prototype 3</h1>
								<div class="Epara">
									<p>After addressing the feedback from our user testing, we decided to keep the tokens as an incentive but added the element of betting your tokens and we added a time element that increased the speed of the game. Still, the group made improvements upon the game, and helped us to re-work it towards another iteration.</p>
